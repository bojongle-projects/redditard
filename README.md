# Redditard Outline

# 👀 Problem

The proliferation of low-effort content on youtube

Especially in reference to Reddit text to speech videos 

They must be the easiest things in the world to produce and make an obscene amount of money. 

It bothers me to my soul

# 💭 Proposal

> **I intend to design a machine learning model that will generate these text-to-speech videos from top to (almost) bottom.**
> 
> 
> I will feed it real-world data to give it a sort of perception of reality 
> 
> A key data-set will be scraped from story related reddit content
> 
> Think things like [r/letsnotmeet](https://reddit.com/r/letsnotmeet)

# 🛫 Plan

1. Gather Datasets that are deemed “of value”
2. Build a lightweight kubernetes cluster to host the machine learning model
3. Set up a tensorflow model to process the data
4. continue training the model until satisfied
